How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the China Se@@ a more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
He is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ anced on the single hope of his country &apos;s un@@ ity and freedom .
Imagine him as the communi@@ sts enter Sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Wor@@ ds , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
He re@@ treated into silence .
He died broken by history .
